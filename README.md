# Arduino_Uno

Projects with Arduino, Breadboard, Sensors

1. Sequential LED control
   Devices used: 3 resistors (330 ohms each) , 3 LED's of different colors, Male to male jumper wires, Arduino, 9v power adapter

   The ground of arduino is connected to the negative branch of breadboard
   One branch of Resistors are connected parallel (along) negative branch

   LED -> positive and negative , negative is connected to the resistor
   Write the code and upload it to arduino, disconnect the C cable and use the power adapter to see the working of the program.
