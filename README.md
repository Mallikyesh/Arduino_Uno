Projects with Arduino, Breadboard, Sensors

1. Sequential LED control
   Devices used: 3 resistors (330 ohms each) , 3 LED's of different colors, Male to male jumper wires, Arduino, 9v power adapter

   The ground of arduino is connected to the negative branch of breadboard
   One branch of Resistors are connected parallel (along) negative branch

   LED -> positive and negative , negative is connected to the resistor
   Write the code and upload it to arduino, disconnect the C cable and use the power adapter to see the working of the program.



2. Parking sensor


Components needed:
Breadboard
Arduino Uno
Jumper wires (Male to Male and Female to Male)
3xLED
3x 220 ohm resistor (Use resistor color code to find the resistor)
Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

On Ultrasonic sensor, look at the pins ,
 GND is connected to the blue line on top of breadboard.. 
Echo should be connected to pin 9 on arduino
TRIG should be connected to pin 10 on arduino
VCC to 5v of arduino
